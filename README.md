# Overview
The purpose of this project is to get more experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP).  This neural network was created to sift through tweets directed at airlines and label them as "positive", "negative", or "neutral".  

# Initial Results
The initial results of the neural network was an accuracy of 76.5% on an unseen test set. 
To give a reference, the total number of negative tweets in the test set was about 61.2%.  Therefore, there was a 15.3% difference between labeling all tweets negative and using a neural network.  

# Future Steps
The results were as stated, initial.  Further tweaking to the neural network will be undertaken to see if results can be improved.  
I want to eventually include another neural network that will summarize the negative and positive tweets respectively and summarize the content into a couple of bullet points to give feedback to business leaders and consumer sentiment.
